The increasing prevalence of uncollected trash in public spaces poses a severe environmental threat that demands immediate attention and action. To address this issue, this project proposes an innovative solution that redefines the process of waste collection by introducing an engaging and gamified approach. The proposed solution is a machine learning-powered mobile application that employs a body camera to seamlessly detect and categorize trash in real-time, rewarding participants with points for each successfully collected item. 
The app leverages computer vision techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm, to achieve accurate and efficient trash recognition. Additionally, the project incorporates MediaPipe's hand-tracking capabilities to recognize the gesture of grabbing trash items, further enhancing the interactivity and user experience. 
The target audience for this solution comprises individuals who are devoted to enhancing the environment. By offering a gamified approach, the project aims to encourage these individuals to actively participate in trash collection efforts, making the process both enjoyable and rewarding. The verification plan includes a comprehensive set of tests to assess the accuracy of hand detection, trash item recognition, counting mechanisms, and overall system performance, as well as gathering feedback from users to evaluate the efficiency and user-friendliness of the application. 
The successful implementation of this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the reduction of uncollected trash in public spaces, fostering environmental awareness and encouraging community-driven initiatives for a cleaner and more sustainable future.
